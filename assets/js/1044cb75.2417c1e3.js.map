This level is based on the commonalities of the Slavic languages. Thus, it has grammatical gender (present in all Slavic languages), seven cases (present in all Slavic languages except Bulgarian and Macedonian), verbal aspect and full conjugation of verbs. However, the Slavic languages are notorious for their complex grammars, and to avoid endless tables with nominal and verbal paradigms, a great deal of simplification is still required. To find a good balance between naturalism and simplicity, we try to approach the naturally existing forms as closely as possible by using the easiest possible means.

In the case of verbs, the numerous verbal classes that exist in Slavic have been reduced to a simple system of two stems, the infinitive stem and the present tense stem. The latter is almost always the logical result of the first, and only in a few cases they have to be learned separately.
