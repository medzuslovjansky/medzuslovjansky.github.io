Still, it can better be avoided, because a construction like that sounds clumsy to those Slavs who are not accustomed to using the verb \u201eto be\u201d very often, especially in the present tense. Besides, while it is perfectly natural for part of the Slavic speakers, for others the past passive participle cannot be used for a present tense construction at all. Therefore, if the subject is known, it is better to utilise a normal active sentence. And if the subject isn't known, as in the case of our pizza, it is possible to use third person plural form without the subject: ",(0,i.jsx)(a,{children:"D\u011blajut picu"})," \u201eThey make pizza, one makes pizza, pizza is being made\u201d. Even more common is a reflexive construction: ",(0,i.jsx)(a,{children:"Pica d\u011blaje se"}),", which literally means \u201ePizza is making itself\u201d and should be translated as \u201eOne makes pizza, pizza is being made\u201d."]}),"\n","\n",(0,i.jsx)(t,{})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,i.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}function u(e,n){throw new Error("Expected "+(n?"component":"object")+" `"+e+"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.")}}}]);
