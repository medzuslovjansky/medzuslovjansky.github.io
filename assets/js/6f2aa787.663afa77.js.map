More than anything else, it is based on linguistic similarity, because the Slavic language family is essentially one large continuum of closely related dialects with a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibility. Throughout the centuries, Slavs have explored the centre of this continuum in various ways: ordinary people learned to talk to their neighbours by means of simple, improvised language forms, while linguists and others have attempted to describe a generic Slavic language that would be understandable to all Slavs alike, often, albeit not always, taking Old Church Slavonic as a starting point.\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"In other words, Interslavic is a language with three different aspects:\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.ul, {\n      children: [\"\\n\", _jsx(_components.li, {\n        children: \"it is an improvised ad hoc language that evolves spontaneously in Inter-Slavic contacts\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.li, {\n        children: \"it is a scientific interpolation of the hypothetic language at the very centre of the Slavic languages\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.li, {\n        children: \"it is a modernised continuation of the common ancestor of the Slavic languages (Proto-Slavic) or its close relative, Old Church Slavonic\"\n      }), \"\\n\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Although the Slavic languages share enough characteristics in grammar, vocabulary and syntax to allow for some basic mutual understanding, each language has idiosyncrasies that stand in the way of full understanding.

It can be learned and used as a Slavic Esperanto, but it can also be treated as a set of recommendations for altering any Slavic language as to facilitate communication with other Slavic speakers.
