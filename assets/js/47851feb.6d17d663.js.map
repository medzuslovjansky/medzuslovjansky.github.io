Besides, Russia has always been a huge empire, a regional superpower, and it is the only Slavic country with an unbroken tradition of statehood. Not surprisingly, Russian has been advocated as a Pan-Slavic language mostly by Russian Pan-Slavists, who have always made it abundantly clear that Russian hegemony is a conditio sine qua non for a Slavic state, and this is precisely why the idea never gained much popularity among the smaller Slavic nations. Even though they recognise their cultural ties with Russia, they refuse be treated as „disfigured Russians“ and most them do not have the best experience with Russian domination.

This language has several advantages: it is very closely related to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, and has a long tradition of use in Orthodox liturgy, thus being both a common ground and a common influence for many Slavic languages. It has the additional advantage of not being anybody's native language, so that it can easily be put forward as a neutral, international language similar to Latin or Sanskrit. In spite of these assets, however, Old Church Slavonic has several practical drawbacks as well. The fact that it was positioned as a sacred language has made it particularly resistant to change, so that even the later „redactions“ are little more than the original with some \", _jsx(_components.em, {\n        children: \"couleur locale\"\n      }), \" mixed in. As a result, Old Church Slavonic has an abundantly rich orthography containing several characters and sounds that have fallen out of use, an equally rich and therefore complicated grammar, and an extremely archaic vocabulary, featuring words that have not survived in any of the contemporary languages, yet lacking words for modern concepts. As early as the 17th century Juraj Križanić, arguably the first Pan-Slavist, noted that Old Church Slavonic had become too archaic to be feasible as a Pan-Slavic language. In other words, it would require some thorough modernisation, and this is where \", _jsx(_components.strong, {\n        children: \"Interslavic\"\n      }), \" comes in.

It was completed in 1666 and is often quoted as the first constructed Interslavic language. In later years, his example has been followed by many others. In the 19th century, when Pan-Slavism was at its peak, another ten projects by Czech, Slovak, Slovene and Croatian authors saw the light. Of these, most elaborate were: \", _jsx(_components.code, {\n        children: \"Universalis Lingua Slavica\"\n      }), \", published in 1826 by the Slovak Ján Herkeľ, a language based primarily on the West Slavic languages; \", _jsx(_components.code, {\n        children: \"Vsjeslovianьskyь\"\n      }), \", based on Church Slavonic and published in 1861 by the Czech Vaceslav Bambas; and \", _jsx(_components.code, {\n        children: \"Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski\"\n      }), \", published in 1865 by the Slovene Matija Majar-Ziljski. Whereas most projects were aimed at reviving and modernising (Old) Church Slavonic, Majar chose an entirely different approach. His project was based on the idea that Slavs could make themselves better understandable to other Slavs taking their own language as a starting point and then gradually modifying it. The first step in that process was altering the orthography, resulting in a generic („mutual“) Pan-Slavic orthography. Subsequently, he proposed a grammar that was based on linguistic comparison of the five major Slavic languages of those days: Russian, Polish, Czech, Serbian and Old Church Slavonic.\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"In the 20th century, several new projects appeared, mostly by Czech authors.

Secondly, Interslavic was no longer the domain of linguists and Pan-Slavists anymore, and everybody now had the chance to share his ideas on the Internet. And thirdly, thanks to the new means of communication, authors were no longer forced to work in isolation.
