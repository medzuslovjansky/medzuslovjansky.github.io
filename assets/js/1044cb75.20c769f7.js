Grammatical gender does not play a role at this level, noun cases are absent, and verbal conjugation remains limited to a bare minimum. The few forms that remain (for example, plurals) should be recognisable for Slavs without any prior study, and memorising them should be a matter of minutes rather than of hours.

This level is based on the commonalities of the Slavic languages. Thus, it has grammatical gender (present in all Slavic languages), seven cases (present in all Slavic languages except Bulgarian and Macedonian), verbal aspect and full conjugation of verbs. However, the Slavic languages are notorious for their complex grammars, and to avoid endless tables with nominal and verbal paradigms, a great deal of simplification is still required. To find a good balance between naturalism and simplicity, we try to approach the naturally existing forms as closely as possible by using the easiest possible means. Irregularity is avoided, unless easy recognisability is seriously jeopardised. Artificiality is avoided as well."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(a.p,{children:["Most important is that every grammatical ending is instantly recognisable, even if the inflected form of a word looks different in someone's own language. For example, most Slavic languages can have various endings for the genitive singular of a masculine noun, but there is one ending they all have in common: ",(0,i.jsx)(a.code,{children:"-a"}),", which therefore is the solution for all occurrences of this form. In the case of verbs, the numerous verbal classes that exist in Slavic have been reduced to a simple system of two stems, the infinitive stem and the present tense stem. The latter is almost always the logical result of the first, and only in a few cases they have to be learned separately. Thanks to this approach, a lot of simplification is achieved without sacrificing the naturalistic character of the language."]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.p,{children:"This level is suitable for contacts and publications, but also as a means to gain insight into the nature of Slavic."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(s,{})]})}const d=function(e={}){const{wrapper:a}=Object.assign({},(0,t.ah)(),e.components);return a?(0,i.jsx)(a,Object.assign({},e,{children:(0,i.jsx)(h,e)})):h(e)};function u(e,a){throw new Error("Expected "+(a?"component":"object")+" `"+e+"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.")}},1151:(e,a,n)=>{n.d(a,{Zo:()=>r,ah:()=>s});var i=n(7294);const t=i.createContext({});function s(e){const a=i.useContext(t);return i.useMemo((()=>"function"==typeof e?e(a):{...a,...e}),[a,e])}const o={};function r({components:e,children:a,disableParentContext:n}){let r;return r=n?"function"==typeof e?e({}):e||o:s(e),i.createElement(t.Provider,{value:r},a)}}}]);
