This language has several advantages: it is very closely related to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, and has a long tradition of use in Orthodox liturgy, thus being both a common ground and a common influence for many Slavic languages. It has the additional advantage of not being anybody's native language, so that it can easily be put forward as a neutral, international language similar to Latin or Sanskrit. In spite of these assets, however, Old Church Slavonic has several practical drawbacks as well. The fact that it was positioned as a sacred language has made it particularly resistant to change, so that even the later \u201eredactions\u201c are little more than the original with some ",(0,n.jsx)(a.em,{children:"couleur locale"})," mixed in. As a result, Old Church Slavonic has an abundantly rich orthography containing several characters and sounds that have fallen out of use, an equally rich and therefore complicated grammar, and an extremely archaic vocabulary, featuring words that have not survived in any of the contemporary languages, yet lacking words for modern concepts. As early as the 17th century Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107, arguably the first Pan-Slavist, noted that Old Church Slavonic had become too archaic to be feasible as a Pan-Slavic language. In other words, it would require some thorough modernisation, and this is where ",(0,n.jsx)(a.strong,{children:"Interslavic"})," comes in.

It was completed in 1666 and is often quoted as the first constructed Interslavic language. In later years, his example has been followed by many others. In the 19th century, when Pan-Slavism was at its peak, another ten projects by Czech, Slovak, Slovene and Croatian authors saw the light. Of these, most elaborate were: ",(0,n.jsx)(a.code,{children:"Universalis Lingua Slavica"}),", published in 1826 by the Slovak J\xe1n Herke\u013e, a language based primarily on the West Slavic languages; ",(0,n.jsx)(a.code,{children:"Vsjeslovian\u044csky\u044c"}),", based on Church Slavonic and published in 1861 by the Czech Vaceslav Bambas; and ",(0,n.jsx)(a.code,{children:"Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski"}),", published in 1865 by the Slovene Matija Majar-Ziljski. Whereas most projects were aimed at reviving and modernising (Old) Church Slavonic, Majar chose an entirely different approach. His project was based on the idea that Slavs could make themselves better understandable to other Slavs taking their own language as a starting point and then gradually modifying it. The first step in that process was altering the orthography, resulting in a generic (\u201emutual\u201c) Pan-Slavic orthography.
