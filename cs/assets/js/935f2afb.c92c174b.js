It has grammatical gender, six cases plus an optional vocative, verbal aspect and full conjugation \u2013 things that virtually every Slav is familiar with. In addition, it also contains some material that is absent in most Slavic languages, but knowledge of which can be of great help in understanding the languages that use it.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/nouns":{"id":"learn/grammar/nouns","title":"Nouns","description":"Like most Slavic languages, nouns in Interslavic have three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural) and seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative). The vocative, used for addressing a person or object directly, is actually not a real case, as it behaves significantly different from other cases: it exists only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns, it never affects adjectives or pronouns, and it has nothing to do with the syntactic structure of the sentence.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/numerals":{"id":"learn/grammar/numerals","title":"Numerals","description":"Cardinal numbers \\\\","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/prepositions":{"id":"learn/grammar/prepositions","title":"Prepositions","description":"Conjunctions \\\\","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/pronouns":{"id":"learn/grammar/pronouns","title":"Pronouns","description":"Personal and reflexive pronouns \\\\","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/syntax":{"id":"learn/grammar/syntax","title":"Syntax","description":"Word order is basically free, but the preferred (and stylistically most neutral) word order is subject \u2013 verb \u2013 object (SVO). It is not mandatory, but note that placing the object before the subject will not help in making clear the meaning. This is not the case of sentences where either a personal pronoun or the pronoun kto is either subject or object, because personal pronouns and kto have their own accussative forms, so the meaning is always clear.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/verbs":{"id":"learn/grammar/verbs","title":"Verbs","description":"Perfective and imperfective aspect \\\\","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/introduction/constructed-slavic-languages":{"id":"learn/introduction/constructed-slavic-languages","title":"Constructed Slavic languages","description":"Like many other large language families, the Slavic languages have inspired language creators to build an artificial Slavic language. Either just for fun (a hypothetical North Slavic language, for instance), or with the purpose of creating a language understandable for speakers of different Slavic languages. During the course of history, many attempts have been made at a Slavic interlanguage. Sometimes these efforts have a political (Pan-Slavic) background, sometimes they are simply based on the assumption that the Slavic languages are similar enough to each other to make such a language possible at all. Here follows a list of auxiliary Slavic languages, created over the years.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/introduction/design-criteria":{"id":"learn/introduction/design-criteria","title":"Design criteria","description":"Interslavic is based on the common heritage of all Slavic nations, and differences are bridged by building compromises. All Slavic languages are treated equally, although it cannot be avoided that a Slavic interlanguage is closer to \u201emiddle-of-the-road\u201c languages like Slovak or Rusyn than to peripheral languages like Sorbian or Macedonian. Interslavic is explicitly not meant to be \u201emore Slavic than the Slavs\u201c by purifying it from foreign influences, even though a language based on the commonalities of the Slavic languages will automatically eliminate many local (non-Slavic) influences anyway. There is, however, no reason to exclude international vocabulary, provided that it can be recognised by all, or at least most, Slavic speakers.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/introduction/faq":{"id":"learn/introduction/faq","title":"Frequently asked questions","description":"How to learn and use Interslavic? \\\\","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/introduction/history":{"id":"learn/introduction/history","title":"History of Interslavic","description":"The history of the Interslavic language is closely connected with Pan-Slavism, an ideology that believes that the Slavs are one nation and aims at their cultural and political unification. Along with the idea of a common Slavic state comes also the idea of a common Slavic language. From the beginning, the question has been what this language should look like.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/introduction/index":{"id":"learn/introduction/index","title":"\xdavod","description":"Co je mezislovan\u0161tina? \\\\","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/misc/numbers-1-10":{"id":"learn/misc/numbers-1-10","title":"The Numbers 1-10 in Slavic Languages","description":"Natural Slavic languages","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/misc/pan-slavic-relay":{"id":"learn/misc/pan-slavic-relay","title":"The Pan-Slavic Relay","description":"The Pan-Slavic Relay took place in September-October 2009.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/misc/personal-pronouns":{"id":"learn/misc/personal-pronouns","title":"Personal pronouns in the Slavic languages","description":"Interslavic is entirely based on the natural Slavic languages, and the forms have been picked on the basis of both comparison and logic.
