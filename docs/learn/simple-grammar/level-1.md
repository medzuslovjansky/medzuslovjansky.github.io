In the [Interslavic dictionary][1] you will find other characters as well, like `ò`, `ų`, `å` or `ť`. You can simply ignore the diacritics and read them as `o`, `u`, `a`, `t` etc. That goes for `ě`, too. The only characters that keep their diacritics in Latin orthography are `č`, `š` and `ž`. If you find writing them inconvenient, you can always use `cz`, `sz` and `zs` (or `cx`, `sx` and `zx`) as an alternative.

Accentuation is fairly free. What matters more is that you speak slowly and clearly. As a general guideline, it would deserve recommendation to put stress on the antepenultimate syllable.

## Grammar

### Nouns

- Nouns can end in a consonant or `-a`, `-o`, `-e`.
- :notr[Slovianto] does not have articles. Therefore, :isv[žena] can mean „a woman” or „the woman”.
- The plural is formed by adding `-i` if the word ends in a consonant, or by replacing the final vowel by **-i**:
  - :isv[muž] „man” → :isv[muži] „men”
  - :isv[žena] „woman” → :isv[ženi] „women”
  - :isv[slovo] „word” → :isv[slovi] „words”

### Adjectives

- Adjectives usually have the ending `-y` or `-i`. They are not inflected and should be placed before the noun.

- An adjective can be made into an adverb by substituting `-y` with the ending `-o`:

  :isv[dobry] „good” → :isv[dobro] „well”

- Adjectives are compared by means of the words :isv[vyše] („more”), :isv[menje] („less”), :isv[naj-] („most”) and :isv[najmenje] („least”):
  - :isv[dobry] „good”
  - :isv[vyše dobry] „better”
  - :isv[naj-dobry] „best”
  - :isv[menje dobry] „less good”
  - :isv[najmenje dobry] „least good”

### Personal pronouns

- Unlike nouns, personal pronouns in :notr[Slovianto] distinguish between the _nominative_ (the subject of the sentence, the agent) and the _accusative_ (the object, patient).

- The subject forms are: :isv[ja] „I”, :isv[ty] „you (:abbr[sg.]), thou”, :isv[on] „he”, :isv[ona] „she”, :isv[my] „we”, :isv[vy] „you (:abbr[pl.])”, :isv[oni] „they”.

- The object forms are: :isv[mene] „me”, :isv[tebe] „you (:abbr[sg.]), thee”, :isv[jego] „him”, :isv[ju] „her”, :isv[nas] „us”, :isv[vas] „you (:abbr[pl.])”, :isv[jih] „them”.

- Like most natural Slavic languages, Interslavic has T-V distinction, i.e. :isv[vy] and :isv[vas] are used not only for the second person plural, but also as a polite form in the singular. :isv[Ty]/:isv[tebe] are used to address friends, relatives and children.

- :notr[Slovianto] also has a reflexive pronoun, :isv[se], meaning „oneself, myself, yourself, ...”. It has no subject form, only an object form.

- This reflexive pronoun can also be used as a reciprocal pronoun. :isv[Oni myt se] means: „they are washing themselves”, but can also mean: „they are washing each other”.

- A preposition is always followed by the accusative:
  - :isv[s mene] „with me”
  - :isv[bez jego] „without him”
  - :isv[za tebe] „behind you”

- For the _indirect object_, the preposition `k` „to, towards” can be added:

  :isv[Dajte k mene ...] „Give me ...”

### Possessive pronouns

- The possessive pronouns are: :isv[moj] „my”, :isv[tvoj] „your, thy”, :isv[jego] „his, its”, :isv[jej] „her”, :isv[naš] „our”, :isv[vaš] „your (:abbr[pl.])”, :isv[jih] „their”. Like adjectives, possessive pronouns are not inflected.
- If the possessor is also the subject of the sentence, the reflexive :isv[svoj] „one's own” is used for all persons.
- There are also interrogative and indefinite possessive pronouns, like :isv[čij] „whose”, :isv[ničij] „nobody's”, :isv[něčij] „somebody's”, :isv[čij-koli] „anybody's”.

### Demonstrative pronouns

- The demonstrative pronoun is :isv[toj] „this, that, these, those”.
- Whenever it is necessary to make a distinction between _here_ and _there_, we have it preceded by `tu-` „here” or `tam-` „there”: :isv[tutoj] „this, these”, :isv[tamtoj] „that, those”.
- When used independently, use :isv[to]:
  - :isv[Čto jest to?] „What is this?”
  - :isv[To jest kniga.] „This is a book.”

### Relative pronouns

- In a simplified language like :notr[Slovianto], it is better to avoid subordinate clauses. But if you need a relative pronoun anyway, use :isv[ktory] „which”.

### Interrogative and indefinite pronouns

- There are two basic pronouns: :isv[kto] „who” and :isv[čto] „what”. Just like personal pronouns, :isv[kto] has an accusative :isv[kogo] for the direct object.
- Derived from these are also several indefinite pronouns, e.g. :isv[někto] „somebody”, :isv[kto-koli] „anybody”, :isv[ničto] „nothing”, :isv[vsečto] „everything” (see the following section).

### Pronominal adverbs

- Every language has a special category of interrelated pronouns, adverbs and adjectives, the so-called `correlatives`. In short, these are question words and the words that are used to give a general answer to these questions. In English, as well as many other languages, these words are related with each other in a fairly predictable way (for example: _where/here/there/somewhere/anywhere/nowhere/everywhere, whence/hence/thence, etc.)_. This is the case in :notr[Slovianto], too.
- Question words usually start with a `k-`: :isv[kto] „who”, :isv[kogda] „when”, :isv[kde] „where”, :isv[ktory] „which”, :isv[koliko] „how many”
- If the answer is a specific thing, place etc., the word starts with `t-`: :isv[to] „this, that”, :isv[togda] „then”, :isv[toliko] „this many”
- If the answer is something unknown or unspecified, the word starts with `ně-` (followed by the question word): :isv[někto] „someone”, :isv[někogda] „sometime, one day”, :isv[někde] „somewhere, someplace”
- If the answer is negative, the word begins with `ni-` (followed by the question word): :isv[nikto] „nobody”, :isv[nikogda] „never”, :isv[nikde] „nowhere”
- If the answer is something unimportant, the word ends with `-koli`, added to the question word: :isv[kto-koli] „anyone”, :isv[kogda-koli] „anytime, whenever”, :isv[kde-koli] „anywhere, whereever”
- If the answer is all-encompassing, the word begins with `vse-` or `ves-`: :isv[vsegda] „always”, :isv[vesde] „everywhere”

### Numerals

- The _cardinal numbers_ from 1-10 are:

  1 – :isv[jedin], 2 – :isv[dva], 3 – :isv[tri], 4 – :isv[četyri], 5 – :isv[pet], 6 – :isv[šest], 7 – :isv[sedm], 8 – :isv[osm], 9 – :isv[devet], 10 – :isv[deset]

- The „-teens” (11-19) are formed by adding `-nadset`:

  11 – :isv[jedinnadset], 12 – :isv[dvanadset], ...

- The „-ties” (20, 30 ... 90) are formed by adding `-deset`:

  20 – :isv[dvadeset], 30 – :isv[trideset], ...

- The „-hundreds” (200, 300 ... 900) are formed by adding `-sto`:

  200 – :isv[dvasto], 300 – :isv[tristo], ...

- Higher numbers:

  1,000 – :isv[tyseč], 1,000,000 – :isv[milion], 1,000,000,000 – :isv[miliard]

- Combinations of these are always made from high to low:

  5,678 – :isv[pet-tyseč šeststo sedmdeset osm]

- _Ordinal numbers_ are formed by adding `-y` to the corresponding cardinal number, except for the following:

  1st – :isv[prvy], 2nd – :isv[drugy], 3rd – :isv[tretji], 4th – :isv[četvrty], 100th – :isv[sotny] or :isv[stoty], 1000th – :isv[tysečny]

### Verbs

- All verbs have the _infinitive_ ending `-ti`:
  - :isv[dělati] „to do”
  - :isv[prositi] „to ask”
  - :isv[nesti] „to carry”

- The _stem_ is obtained by removing the ending `-ti` from the infinitive:
  - :isv[děla-]
  - :isv[prosi-]
  - :isv[nes-]

- At this early stage, one ending for the _present tense_ will do. It is formed by adding `-t` to the stem. If the present tense stem ends in a consonant, `-e-` is inserted between the stem and the ending:
  - :isv[ja děla-t] „I do”
  - :isv[vy prosi-t] „you ask”
  - :isv[oni nes-et] „they carry”

- And here's a bit of irregularity that happens so often in Slavic that you might as well learn it now: if the stem ends in `k` or `g`, these consonants become `č` and `ž` before the inserted `e`:
  - :isv[pekti] „to bake” → :isv[pečet]
  - :isv[mogti] „can” → :isv[možet]

- For the _past tense_, add `-l` (singular) or `-li` (plural) to the stem:
  - :isv[ja děla-l] „I did, I have done”
  - :isv[on prosi-l] „he asked”
  - :isv[my nes-li] „we carried”

- For the _future tense_, use `bude` with the infinitive:
  - :isv[ja bude dělati] „I will do”
  - :isv[my bude prositi] „we will ask”
  - :isv[oni bude nesti] „they will carry”

- The _conditional_ is formed by using the particle :isv[by] with the past tense:
  - :isv[ja by dělal] „I would do/I would have done”

- The _imperative_ has the ending `-jte` after a vowel or `-ite` after a consonant:
  - :isv[děla-jte] „do!”
  - :isv[prosi-jte] „ask!”
  - :isv[nes-ite] „carry!”

- The _past passive participle_ is created by adding `-ny` to the stem. If the stem ends in a consonant, insert `-e-` between the stem and the ending. If the stem ends in `-i-`, then insert `-e-` and change resulting `-ieny` to `-jeny`:
  - :isv[děla-ny] „done”
  - :isv[nes-eny] „carried”
  - :isv[prosi-eny] → :isv[prosjeny] „asked”

- The verb :isv[byti] „to be” is irregular:
  - present tense: :isv[jest]
  - past tense: :isv[byl], :isv[byli]
  - future tense: :isv[bude]
  - conditional: :isv[byl by, byli by]
  - imperative: :isv[budite]

- The _passive voice_ is created as in English, by combining a form of the verb :isv[byti] „to be” with the past passive participle:
  - :isv[ja jest neseny] „I am being carried”
  - :isv[ja byl neseny] „I was being carried, I have been carried”, etc.

### Syntax

- The preferred word order is subject – verb – object, like in English. It isn't mandatory, but any other word order might easily make a sentence unclear or ambiguous.

- Adjectives, possessive pronouns and the like are preferably placed before the noun they modify:

  :isv[toj dobry kniga] „this good book”

- Yes-no questions differ from normal indicative sentences only by intonation:
  - :isv[Otec kupil kniga] „Father has bought a book.”
  - :isv[Otec kupil kniga?] „Has father bought a book?”

- In other questions, the interrogative pronoun or adverb comes first:
  - :isv[Kaky kniga kupil otec?] „What kind of book has father bought?”
  - :isv[Kde otec kupil toj kniga?] „Where did father buy that book?”

- The easiest way for expressing possession is simply placing the possessor before the possessed. When this is not clear enough, use the preposition `od` „from, of”:
  - :isv[moj otec kniga] „my father's book” (lit. „my father book”)
  - :isv[kniga od moj otec] „my father's book” (lit. „the book of my father”)

- Likewise, you don't need to use any special accessories for the indirect object. Whenever this is not clear enough, use the preposition `k` „to”:
  - :isv[Dajte moj otec toj kniga.] „Give that book to my father.”
  - :isv[Dajte toj kniga k moj otec.] „Give that book to my father.”

- To express the instrument used for something, use the preposition `s` „with”:
  - :isv[Ja udaril svoj otec s toj kniga.] „I hit my father with that book.”
