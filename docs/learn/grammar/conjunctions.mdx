# Conjunctions

Most prepositions in Slovianski govern the genitive. This is especially true for all prepositions that were derived from nouns, adjectives or adverbs. In the case of prepositions referring to place and time, the following can be assumed as a guideline, although there are exceptions:

- the **genitive case** is used when a movement away from/out of a location is indicated.
- the **accusative case** is used when a movement towards/into a location is indicated;
- the **instrumental** or **locative case** is used when the location is stable, i.e. there is no movement at all.

Prepositions should only be used according to their logical meaning, not according to national idioms. Here follows a list of prepositions in Slovianski:

**With the genitive**

:isv[bez] – without
:isv[blizko] – near, close to
:isv[dlja] – for

**With the accusative**

:isv[črěz, prěz] – through, across, via
:isv[po] – for (in pursuit of, to get something); for (the Xth time); up to

:isv[za] – for, because of, due to, in exchange for, in favour of, instead of

**With the locative**

:isv[o, ob] – about; concerning, regarding
:isv[po] – after, following; along(side); throughout, round, all over

:isv[pri] – near; during (rule of a king)

**With the accusative and the instrumental**

The following five prepositions refer to place and (if applicable) time. The instrumental is used when the location is stable (:isv[Kot spi pod stolom] – "The cat is sleeping under the table"), the accusative expresses a motion toward it (:isv[Kot poběgl pod stol] – "The cat fled under the table").

The preposition :isv[za] can also be used with the genitive and (in other meanings) the accusative, but because otherwise it belongs to the same category as the rest, it has been listed there separately.

:isv[medžu] – between (place & time)
:isv[nad] – above, over, beyond
:isv[pod] – under

:isv[prěd] – before, in front of, ahead of (place & time), prior to, ago
:isv[za] – behind (place), after (time)

**With the accusative and the locative**

The prepositions :isv[v] and :isv[na] behave exactly like the previous category, except that for a stable location the locative is used instead of the instrumental.

:isv[na] (+ :abbr[loc.]) – on, at; (+ :abbr[acc.]) – on(to), unto

:isv[v, vo] (+ :abbr[loc.]) – in, within; (+ :abbr[acc.]) – into
