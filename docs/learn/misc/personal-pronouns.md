# Personal pronouns in the Slavic languages

Interslavic is entirely based on the natural Slavic languages, and the forms have been picked on the basis of both comparison and logic. This page demonstrates how this has been done in the case of personal pronouns:

## First person singular

<FirstPersonSingular />

:::note

- All West and South Slavic languages have special short forms in the accusative, genitive and dative. We have adopted them in Interslavic, seeing that it won't hurt intelligibility, and certainly adds some expressivity.
- The genitive is generally the same as the accusative.
- The locative is often very similar or identical to the dative.
- The genitive is never identical to the dative.
- The accusative `mene` in Interslavic is based on counting (discounting the smaller languages): 7 `men`-, 3 `mn`-; 8 -`e`, 2 -`ja`.

:::

## Second person singular

<SecondPersonSingular />

:::note

The majority solution for the dative would be `tebě`, but we want to keep it separate from the genitive/accusative, therefore `tobě`.

:::

## Third person singular, masculine and neuter

<ThirdPersonSingularMasculine />

:::note

- The forms themselves are established easily.
- For all forms on `je-` or `i-` goes that they can be preceded by `n-` after a preposition: _`jego > bez njego_, _im > pri nim`_. The same goes for the other genders and the plural.

:::

## Third person singular, feminine

<ThirdPersonSingularFeminine />

## First person plural

<FirstPersonPlural />

## Second person plural
