# Intelligibility Builder

Construct a special notation to indicate the intelligibility of a given form in the Slavic languages. Drag and drop a synset XML file to the table below to get started (see [an example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/medzuslovjansky/database/beta/synsets/00/00/01/oko.xml)). After you finish with the table, hover over the code and click the "Copy" button to copy the code to your clipboard.
