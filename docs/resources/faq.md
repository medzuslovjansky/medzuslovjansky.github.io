# FAQ (Frequently asked questions)

### What is Interslavic (Medžuslovjansky)?

Interslavic is a constructed auxiliary language. It is designed to be mutually intelligible for speakers of various Slavic languages without prior learning. It draws from a common base of Slavic vocabulary and grammar. 

### How long does it take to learn Interslavic?

Interslavic has a standard and an extended level of proficiency. For Slavic native speakers, learning the standard level of Interslavic should not take a long time.

We have heard from many people that it took them 2-3 weeks of study to be able to write confidently, it took them  1.5 - 3 months to engage in basic conversations, and they were able to speak confidently on a wide range of topics after 8-10 months. In this case it was non-intensive learning during free time.

However, the time spent is individual and can vary significantly from person to person. If you do not speak any Slavic languages, it will take a considerably longer time to learn Interslavic.

### Does knowing Interslavic help in understanding other Slavic languages?

Yes, generally speaking, knowing Interslavic helps to understand other Slavic languages. You will not 100% understand Slavic languages after learning Interslavic, but your level of understanding will be significantly higher than if you had no knowledge of Interslavic at all.

### Why does Interslavic include non-Slavic words, such as "kalendar"?

The goal of Interslavic is to be immediately accessible and understandable without prior learning. Words like "kalendar" are known to all Slavs, and therefore such words are included in the Interslavic lexicon.

### If I speak my native Slavic language to an Interslavic speaker, will they understand me?

While it is impossible to guarantee understanding in every individual case, many Interslavic speakers have reported being able to understand native Slavic language speakers.

### Is there an automatic translator for Interslavic?

Yes, there is a prototype automatic translator for Interslavic available. It is functional but still requires further development and improvement by programmers. You can try it out here: [Interslavic Translator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salavat/Interslavic-Translator-NLLB200)

- Numerous written texts, including books, short stories, audiobooks, poems, and songs.

Additionally, the Interslavic Discord community has over 7000 members who have collectively written more than a million messages.

### Who needs content in Interslavic: movies, music, texts?

Content in Interslavic is valuable for both learners of the language and native Slavic speakers who are interested in understanding it without prior study. We observe from comments that the majority of viewers of Interslavic content are them, not Interslavic speakers.

Interslavic speakers infrequently watch and comment on Interslavic content; thanks to their knowledge of Interslavic, they are able to find and understand content in other Slavic languages.

### Is there a Duolingo course for Interslavic?

No, there is no a Duolingo course available right now.

### Why do we need Interslavic, if there is English everywhere?

Interslavic, like English, serves as a linguistic bridge. However, it is particularly tailored for the Slavic-speaking world. Vojtěch Merunka and Jan van Steenbergen, authors involved in the development of Interslavic, have noted that while English is a powerful global language, it can be challenging for Slavic speakers due to its unique orthography, mixed vocabulary, irregular grammar, and peculiar phonetics. Interslavic aims to facilitate communication within the Slavic community, preserving cultural nuances that might be lost when using a non-Slavic language.

### Can we just choose a natural Slavic language to serve as the Interslavic language?

Unfortunately, no single natural Slavic language can serve as a mutually intelligible means of communication for all Slavic speakers without prior learning.

### Does Interslavic aim to unite the countries into a single Slavic state?

No. Interslavic is a non-political, linguistic project aimed at fostering communication in tourism, culture, and business.

### What political stance does Interslavic support? Is it a form of Pan-Slavism?

Interslavic is not a form of Pan-Slavism and does not endorse any political stance. It is a purely linguistic project.

### What does it mean that Interslavic is an auxiliary language?

Being an auxiliary language means that Interslavic does not intend to replace any living Slavic languages or serve as a language for high literature—we already have vibrant, living languages for those purposes. Instead, its goal is to aid in communication between people from different linguistic backgrounds.
