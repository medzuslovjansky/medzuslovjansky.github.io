# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### What is Interslavic (Medžuslovjansky)?

Interslavic is a constructed language designed to be mutually intelligible for speakers of various Slavic languages. It draws from a common base of Slavic vocabulary and grammar.

> **Medžuslovjansky** jest jezyk razumlivy priblizno vsim slovjanasko-jezyčnym ljudam bez učenja.
> 
> **Меджусловјанскы** јест језык разумливы приблизно всим словјанско-језычным људам без ученја.

### What does "auxiliary language" mean?

Being an auxiliary language means that Interslavic does not intend to replace any living Slavic languages or serve as a language for high literature — we already have vibrant, living languages for those purposes. Instead, its goal is to aid in communication between people from different linguistic backgrounds.

### How to learn and use Interslavic?

If you're already familiar with a Slavic language:
* Skim through [Interslavic Grammar] and observe any Interslavic text for guidance, for instance, [The Little Prince].
* Refer to [Interslavic Dictionary] for translating words and understanding their declensions.
* Begin composing sentences using the dictionary. Don't be afraid – most Slavic languages have similar enough grammar and vocabulary.
* Expect several months of dedicated learning and practice to become proficient in writing and speaking Interslavic.

If you don't know a Slavic language:
* Review the [Slovianto] tutorial for an introductory language overview.
* Join the Interslavic community on [Discord] and [Facebook] for the latest advice on approaches that suit your needs.

### How long does it take to learn Interslavic?

Interslavic has a standard and an extended level of proficiency.

For Slavic native speakers, learning the standard level of Interslavic should not take a long time – many people reported their learning experience as non-intensive, usually pursued during their free time, and it took them:

* 2-3 weeks of study to write confidently;
* 1.5-3 months to engage in basic conversations;
* 8-10 months to speak confidently on a wide range of topics.

However, the required time is individual and may vary significantly from person to person. If you do not speak Slavic languages, it will take considerably longer to learn Interslavic.

### Is it true that all Slavs can understand Interslavic?

No. A true statement: **many** Slavs can understand Interslavic well enough without any prior study if they have a strong command of their native Slavic language, focus, and a desire to understand.

### If I learn Interslavic, will I understand other Slavic languages?

Rather not. Learning Interslavic improves your comprehension of other Slavic languages, but it is not a shortcut - to get a good grasp of any particular language, you'll have to learn it specifically.

### If I speak my native Slavic language to an Interslavic speaker, will they understand me?

It varies from person to person. Many Interslavic speakers have reported being able to understand speakers of other Slavic languages, but they also noted that their comprehension skills differ depending on the specific language.

### Why does Interslavic include non-Slavic words, such as "kalendar"?

The goal of Interslavic is to be immediately accessible and understandable without prior learning. Words like "kalendar" or "kompjuter" are known to all Slavs; therefore, such words get included in the Interslavic lexicon.

### What are those weird diacritics and letters some people use in Interslavic?

The Interslavic Latin alphabet has only four letters with diacritics: Č :ipa[t͡ʃ], Š :ipa[ʂ], Ž :ipa[ʒ], Ě :ipa[jɛ]. However, some people use additional diacritics and letters to memorize Slavic etymology, so occasionally, you might encounter weird words like :isv[ćuđi], :isv[otėc], :isv[dȯžd́], :isv[gręź], :isv[bųde], :isv[hlåd], :isv[сѫглӑсък], :isv[тѣх], :isv[гѫбоѭ], :isv[показуѥт].

While etymological scripts may help improve pronunciation in advanced stages, they often degrade written text comprehension and are considered non-standard. Therefore, if you are just starting to learn Interslavic, it is recommended to stick to the standard Latin or Cyrillic alphabet and focus on mastering the basics.

### How can I write Interslavic on my own keyboard?

There are several solutions for this:

* Pick one of our [keyboard layouts] for your operating system.
* If you cannot find or install a custom keyboard:
  * standard Interslavic can be written on a **Czech** keyboard,
  * simplified Interslavic (without `Ě`/`Є` and `Y`/`Ы`) – also on a Croatian, Serbian or Slovenian keyboard.
* If you find all this too complicated, you may substitute problematic letters with letters available on your keyboard, too:
  * Poles can write `CZ` instead of `Č`, `SZ` instead of `Š`, `Ż` instead of `Ž`, etc.
  * East Slavs and Bulgarians can write `Й` or `І` instead of `J`, `ЛЬ` instead of `Љ`, `НЬ` instead of `Њ`, etc.
  * For details, see [representation of problematic characters](https://interslavic.fun/learn/orthography/#representation-of-problematic-characters) and remember that such variants might hurt intelligibility.
* For ad-hoc use, you can always use the [transliterator] or the [extended transliterator] (for standard and etymological orthography, respectively) to get the desired result.

### Is there an automatic translator for Interslavic?

Yes, there is a prototype automatic translator for Interslavic available. It is functional but still requires further development and improvement by programmers. You can try it out here: [Interslavic Translator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salavat/Interslavic-Translator-NLLB200)

### Is there a Duolingo course for Interslavic?

No, there is no Duolingo course available right now.

### Who needs content in Interslavic: movies, music, texts?

Interslavic language content is a valuable resource for both learners and native speakers of Slavic languages interested in understanding it without prior study. Based on the comments we get, the majority of viewers of Interslavic content belong to the latter group.

### Why do we need Interslavic if there is English everywhere?

Vojtěch Merunka and Jan van Steenbergen, key authors of the modern Interslavic, have noted that while English is a powerful global language, it can be challenging for Slavic speakers due to its unique orthography, mixed vocabulary, irregular grammar, and peculiar phonetics. Interslavic aims to facilitate communication within the Slavic community, preserving cultural nuances that might be lost when using a non-Slavic language.

See more comparisons between Interslavic and other languages [here].

### Can't we just choose a natural Slavic language to serve as the Interslavic language?

Unfortunately, without prior learning, no single natural Slavic language can serve as a mutually intelligible means of communication for all Slavic speakers.

### Does Interslavic aim to unite the countries into a single Slavic state?

No, Interslavic is a non-political linguistic project. Its objective is to foster communication in tourism, culture, and business.

### What political stance does Interslavic support? Is it a form of Pan-Slavism?

Interslavic is not a form of Pan-Slavism and does not endorse any political stance. It is a purely linguistic project.
